# Final Project: Galaxy Clustering Analysis and BAO Detection

This project uses SDSS DR17 galaxy data with a self-coded BallTree algorithm to compute the two-point correlation function $\xi(r)$ in order to find how many galaxies are within a certain radius from a central galaxy and detect the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak.

Completed as part of AST 347: Cosmology at Stony Brook University, Fall 2025.
